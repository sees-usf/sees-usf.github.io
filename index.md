# The SEES Lab

##### Research for Secure, Efficient, and Evolvable Computing Systems

Welcome!
        
The SEES Lab at the University of South Florida conducts crosscutting research at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and computing, exploring their synergies to advance both computing system design and AI applications. Our research focuses on emerging computer architectures and technologies that improve AI processing efficiency, as well as leveraging AI to transform computing system design for enhanced performance, efficiency, and security. Some of our current research interests are:
  - AI for electronic system design
  - Processor design for efficient AI processing
  - Security of AI-integrated systems
        
        
Other research interests include
  - Computer system verification and validation
  - Verification-aware design methodology
  - Formal methods and model checking</li>
